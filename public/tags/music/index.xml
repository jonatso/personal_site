      <description>This is a remix of a track made by the Norwegian duo ka2. I really love their club music, and I&amp;rsquo;m quite impressed by how successful they&amp;rsquo;ve been with seemingly niche house music, with norwegian lyrics. I wanted to make a remix that was a bit more energetic, inspired by psy trance basslines. I shared it with ka2 and it seemed like they liked it, which was really cool.</description>

      <description>Made this for Kucka&amp;rsquo;s remix competition. I didn&amp;rsquo;t win, but I had a lot of fun making it. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good track, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud of it. I hope you enjoy it too!</description>
