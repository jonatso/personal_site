This is a remix of a track made by the Norwegian duo ka2. I really love their club music, and I'm quite impressed by how successful they've been with seemingly niche house music, with norwegian lyrics. I wanted to make a remix that was a bit more energetic, inspired by psy trance basslines. I shared it with ka2 and it seemed like they liked it, which was really cool! ðŸ¤™
