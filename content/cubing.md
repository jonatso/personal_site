In 2010, my brother received a Rubik's cube as a Christmas gift. A year later, we successfully solved it together. Since then, I have been committed to improving my speed and actively participating in the speedcubing community in Norway. I have competed in over 45 competitions, and have organized a few. You can view my WCA profile [here](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2012SOLH02). I was ranked in the top 10 in Norway from 2013 to 2023, but have recently been surpassed by the new generation of cubers. My goal is still to return to the top 10 and achieve an average time of under 8 seconds, with my current best being 8.12 seconds.
